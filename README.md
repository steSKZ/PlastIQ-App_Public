# PlastIQ-App (Public Version)

Many companies generate various types of plastic waste, which are often poorly recycled due to a lack of information about their quality, composition, availability, and potential buyers or recycling options.

PlastIQ aims to close this gap by evaluating plastic waste and predicting its quantity, quality, and availability. It also matches waste with suitable buyers and recycling options, helping companies maximize reuse and promote circular use of plastic materials.

> üß™ This version is a **clean public release** of the internal PlastIQ App. Proprietary data and sensitive components have been removed.
